    <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
    <p>
      I really love food! It is always there when you are sad, when you want to celebrate, or you are bored! Not to mention, you need food to survive, so there's that too.

    <i>I love most cuisines, but here are my favorites!</i>
  </body>
  <ol>
    <li>
    <b>Thai Food</b>
    <p>Thai food has so much flavor and there are a variety of dishes that are delicious.</p>
    <p>The warm curries and noodle dishes comfort you during the cold, winter days. But they are also amazing during the summer and spring.</p>
    <p>This cuisine is also healthier than others because the herbs and spices, such as garlic, tumeric, and lemongrass, can boost your immunity and can help prevent or relieve inflammation in the body.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Italian Food</b>
    <p>Italian food has so mucuh variety and each restaurant, or time we make it at home, is a little different to keep it interesting.</p>
    <p>Though the cheese makes my stomach hurt sometimes, I love the tomato sauce with the layers of classic Italian oregano. Even the cheese adds flavor to this dish!</p>
    <p>Moreover, there are so many cheeses to choose from. Even cheese beginners (because there are cheese experts!) can find one they like.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
    <b>Indian Food</b>
    <p>I might be a little biased towards this, but Indian food by far has the most depth in flavor and color. Nearly <u>everyone</u> seems to agree that they don't know what truly good food is until they try Indian food.</p>
    <p>Indian food takes staples everyone knows and elevates them. For instance, potatoes and peas with puff pastry creates samosas, yet they are brought to another level with the variety of spices.</p>
    <p>We are the original spice traders after all, so rest assured your food will be flavorful throughout the entire Indian food experience. Even if you are not a big fan of spice, Indian food does not compromise on taste if spice is missing.</p> 
    </li>
  </ol>

    Overall, I love each of these cuisines because they all offer levels of comfort during the entire year, not just the colder months, when I eat them. Hopefully I did this write because I couldn't see the website for most of it! The power went out when I was finishing this up.
